## Using R Markdown

Using an R Markdown document means your analysis and your writing are in one place (this document is all written in R Markdown). 

R Markdown is a type of file that produces documents. It will process your R code and its output, then typeset/produce your file. It uses the same wonderful math language as LaTeX, too.^[A lot of academic work is written in a typesetting language called LaTeX. R Markdown is a bit simpler to get started with and is a solid alternative in most cases.]

To start an R Markdown document, click `File`->`New File`->`R Markdown`. This will set you up and explain a few things:

```{r Rmarkdown, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../atlas/rmarkdown.png")
```

Headers are defined by `#` (for level 1), `##` (for level 2), etc:

```
# My main header

## A subheader
```



```{r out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', eval = FALSE}
boxplot(1:10)
plot(rnorm(10))
```

## Maths

At some point throughout your university life you will need to write equations in a document.
